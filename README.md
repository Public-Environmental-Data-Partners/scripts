# scraping-scripts

This is not your normal GitHub repository.

Instead of containing a single project with a coherent structure, 
it is intended to allow any coders who are working to archive data sets for the Public Environmental Data Project 
(https://www.openenvironmentaldata.org/pilot-type/public-environmental-data-project) 
to upload their working scripts both for safe-keeping and for
others to borrow from.

Eventually, the code in this repo may evolve into a coherent set 
of tools. For now, however, most code should probably be added in 
folders under _/oneTimeHacks_

### oneTimeHacks
If you add code here:
- create a folder for your code, use your own best judgement for a name
- along with any working code, add a _readme.txt_ file that documents:
    - the URL of the primary web page you were archiving
    - the URL of the Dataverse (or other online repository) where your archived data was stored
    - any other notes you want to make about the code you are archiving
