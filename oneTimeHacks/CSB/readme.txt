CSB Scripts Readme
The CSB repository (folder) contains four scripts used to:
1 - Scrape Past Investigations
2 - Scrape Past Recommendations
3 - Download Past Investigations
4 - Download Past Recommendations

They are all written in Python.  In addition to the files themselves, for downloads of Past Investigations, a PDF was generated of the landing page for each incident (investigation).  Recommendations don't have a landing page, so those are not accompanied by a landing page PDF.

The index of the scraping and downloads can be found in the csb_past_investigations.csv for investigations and the csb_recommendations.csv for recommendations. 

There are 1,066 items downloaded for Investigations.

All items will be archived at either Zenodo or Harvard Dataverse (CAFE), and this readme will be updated with that information when it is available.
