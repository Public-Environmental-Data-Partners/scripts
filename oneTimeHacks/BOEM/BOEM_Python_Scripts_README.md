BOEM Python Scripts README
The BOEM_GOAR Python scripts are:
 	boem_goar_catalog.py - creates an Excel catalog of the data on the BOEM GOAR website
	boem_goar_download5_10.py - Downloads the data on the BOEM GOAR website, and catalogues what was downloaded
	boem_lease_status.py - Downloads only the "Lease Status" files (all pdfs)

These scripts were all used to scrape and download files from the BOEM GOAR (Gulf of Mexico GIS Data and Maps).  The data are archived on Zenodo, at DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17833370 .  The metadata for the archive is located at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jRJUUqwjSNHvn9UhnrQiEQMvGFtEOU2WXex3Ys7ma74/edit?tab=t.0 , and also within the Zenodo data.
